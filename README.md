## WTF
Hi, hello, my name is Ntsikayomzi Phenyo Ngcakani. To those who actually bother to read the readme. Please feel free to follow me on this journey as I try to take a detailed look, into
servers, design and structure of what is basically a instagram clone. I'll be creating a web-version so this is an ameteur fullstack instagram program. Those intrested in the frontend will find html, css, and Javascript files in the file marked [docs](https://github.com/TsikaBullRat/Stagramstagram/tree/main/docs).
To those interest in looking at the nodejs server side script, please don't judge me too much. However if it is your first time trying node please follow these steps:

-   Download amd install node
-   Open cmd or terminal via Node.js
-   Change directory to where you project is located
-   Run "npm i" (just incase)
-   Run "node index.js"

And thats it you should have a functioning app running. You can find the site running on localhost:4444

## Structure
What we'll be working with is a node server, a website and a MongoDB database.
